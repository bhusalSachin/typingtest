Hello I will talk about my country Syria that I am proud of that but in the modern era it has become an unjust ruler where tyranny and corruption are in it while it was the most beautiful country on the globe It was invaded by Russian American French and Turkish colonialism It has become like a cake Everyone takes a piece and eats it alone When will we mature with our rational thought? And spiritually and we repent to Almighty God When will we go away from this colonialism and liberate us from the unjust hypocritical infidel who killed innocent people and young children who have no guilt? Bring back ancient Syria

The stakes are especially high for Africaâ€™s small farmers, who work their fields by hand and are at the mercy of the elements. The predictable weather patterns these farmers depended on in the past have disappeared. This year, late rains in Ghana and neighboring West African countries delayed planting. Then, unusually heavy rainfall at the end of the growing season hampered the harvest. In East Africa, swarms of locusts, fostered by hotter, wetter conditions, devoured a vast expanse of crops.

On behalf of the accused candidate, the scholar Counsel has argued that according to Ram Surat, the shot was fired from a distance of 6 steps while according to Ahat Babu Lal Yadav the bullet was fired from a distance of 1-1 / 2 bit. We do not agree that there is a significant contradiction between the testimony of the two eyewitnesses and the medical evidence, despite the distance to be shot. According to medical evidence, blackness has been found on the wound and the shot was fired closely and the testimony of both eyewitnesses is substantially similar. Ram Surat and Babu Lal Yadav have not used the same words when describing the shooting distance. 

I knew I had to look for new ways to guide my children's education.
As a mother as well as an accountant, I have been concerned by the lack of financial education our children receive in school. Many of today's youth have credit cards before they leave high school, yet they have never had a course in money or how to invest it, let alone understand how compound interest works on credit cards. Simply put, without financial literacy and the knowledge of how money works, they are not prepared to face the world that awaits them, a world in which spending is emphasized over savings.
